# Single-Tree-Segmentation-Post-editing-Tool
The program reads all the .txt files in the specified folder, using spaces as delimiters. The columns labeled X, Y, Z (with headers) represent the X, Y, and Z axes of the point cloud. It plots the XY projection of all point clouds and their bounding boxes. When you click on a bounding box, it changes color to indicate selection. Clicking the delete button performs a soft delete of the file it represents (i.e., it marks the file as inactive rather than physically removing it from the disk). You can then undo this action. When you click save, it saves the remaining active point clouds.
